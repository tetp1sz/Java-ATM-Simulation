# 💵 Java ATM Simulation 💵
---
❓_This program attempts to recreate the operation of an ATM._ The simplest operations are realized: withdrawal of money from the account, replenishment and balance viewing. Also, there was an attempt to make user registration (with setting his name and pin code). ~~Registration works, but crookedly.~~ In addition, I failed to make a parser that would be able to read a CSV file when restarting the program, and throw the data from there into the class User, so that you do not have to re-register.

✅ In the process of development I used a lot of crutches, and the code itself is not particularly presentable. But the main task was to work with OOP and learn how to work with files.
